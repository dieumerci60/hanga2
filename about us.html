    <h1>Russia pounds Ukraine with missiles, drones for second day in row, Kyiv says</h1>
    <p>Analysts at the Washington-based think tank Institute for the Study of War, said in their note late on Monday that Moscow "likely lacks the defense-industrial capacity to sustain such massive strikes at a similar scale with regularity."
        Several Russian military bloggers, such as the pro-war collective under the name of Rybar, called the Moscow attacks an "act of retaliation" for Ukraine's surprising incursion into Russia's territory - the first such action since World War Two.
        The Kremlin said on Monday there will be a response to Ukraine's action in Kursk, but three weeks into the incursion, Kyiv claims further advances. Moscow says it keeps pummelling Ukraine troops there - but is still unable to push them out.
